## Acknowledgments

The inspiration for some of the CSS styles in this application comes from various sources on the internet, including design showcases, tutorials, and online communities. Currently, the collection is relatively small, but it will gradually grow as I develop and discover more creative styles that can be showcased and reused.
Feel free to explore the available styles and contribute your own by submitting a pull request. Together, we can build a comprehensive repository of CSS designs and techniques for the benefit of the web development community.
